title: Better Reflection than a Mirror

<h1> Reflecting Better than a Mirror. </h1> 
 <h2> Players either found the flies, or they didn't. Regardless, they learned a lot about the Web. </h2> 
<br> 
   <p> I used a combination of HTML and CSS to make a game where people had to move from page to page, finding flies. It featured code for images, backgrounds, colors, and (in my opinion) some funny jokes. 
  <br> 
    <br> 
     One <strong> challenge </strong> I encountered was that I had difficulty adding customizations to my writing, in terms of mastering the right size, color, and style of my words. I think it was also difficult to coordinate all of the different web pages, with exact uniform spelling so that players can smoothly transition from file to file. 
     <br> 
    <br> 
     One element of my game that I am <strong> proud </strong> of is my coding to make the fly move as the person scrolls down the file. It was one of the advanced coding features, where I could make the fly move down the page, instead of being stationary, and it looked really good! I was also proud of my meme/pop culture references, but that doesn't have to do with coding. 
     <br> 
    <br>
     I could <strong> extend </strong> my game by adding more current pop culture pages, such as the yodelling boy from Walmart, or maybe a spongebob meme. I could also give it a little more plot, so it resembled a traditional choose your own adventure story more.
