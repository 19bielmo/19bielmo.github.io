title: Dreaming about Meme-ing? 
---  

<h2> My Project to help contribute to the school is to present lesson material in a way that is more appealing and easier to understand. In the age of social media, memes can make education more fun! </h2> 
<br>
<p> I plan to create a website that opens to a homepage directed towards all Woodstock students, in the Middle and High school. In a drop-down menu or table of contents type set-up, students can choose the field and class of the lesson they need help with. For example, they could choose math, and algebra to get to Algebra lessons and memes. Studetns can also find specific memes with hashtags, like on instagram! The categories will be math, science, tests, history, english, languages, extracurriculars, and social anti-bulying "wholesome" memes. </p>
